# Michael Hoang's Portfolio 

A collection of various data science projects that I've done. 


## PROJECT 1: Membership Analysis of a Downtown Toronto Gym
A look at the membership history of past and current clients from a boutique training studio in downtown Toronto from 2017 to 2020.  Using data collected from various sources (i.e., internal CSM software, emails, and billing & scheduling software ([wellnessliving.com](www.wellnessliving.com))), I've examined the relationship between several key factors and membership milestones.
