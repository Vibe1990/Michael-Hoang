# Michael Hoang's Portfolio 

A collection of various data science projects that I've done. 


## PROJECT 1: [Membership Analysis of a Downtown Toronto Gym](https://github.com/Vibe1990/Bang_Membership_Analysis)
A look at the membership history of past and current clients from a boutique training studio in downtown Toronto from 2017 to 2020.  Using data collected from various sources (i.e., internal CSM (via [AirTable](www.airtable.com)), emails, and billing & scheduling software ([wellnessliving.com](www.wellnessliving.com))), I've performed a membership survival analysis based on several key factors. 

**Key Factors**: 
    
   * Sociodemographic: age, employment sector
   * Membership history: membership type, monthly rates, attendance/cancellation rates 
   * Types of email interactions

**Notable Outcome Measure**:
    
   * Membership status at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months (using random forest + logistic regression analysis)
   * Length of membership (using cox-regression analysis)
